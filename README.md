# Expose
Guide for my Laravel Applications.

This is the master branch for the repository. I will, later on, add more descriptive branches for the guide as purposed.

## Application Setup
- Run `laravel new ProjectName` in the preferred directory for the project.
- Push to master branch with GIT.
- Confirm application setup by running `php artisan serve`

**You have successfully set up your Laravel application and can proceed to build a cool web application.**
